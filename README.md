# U-Net-for-Medical-Imagery
This Repository is designed for U-net model implementation. Its an end to end mechanism for Image segmentation model. 
The project contains two file data.py and unet.py.
Before execution of the two files the data needs to be set in accordance path format i.e defined inside the code.
Ist step create folder called 'data'
Inside data folder create 'npydata', 'test', and 'train' folders.
Create 'image' and 'label' folders inside test and train folders. 
Place your images in image folder and masks of images in label folder.
Make sure the image and label data is of 32 multiple resolution to ensure the compatibility. 
i.e 64x64, 96X96,128X128,256X256 etc
After folder settings run python3 data.py. After the process is complete 
Then run unet.py
I have trained the Brain Mri dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation) on the model and the results were admirable. You can use your own dataset for it.
